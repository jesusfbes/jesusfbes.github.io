With over 15 years of experience in Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and AI, I bring a combination of academic insight and practical industry expertise. I specialize in building intelligent information systems, applying Natural Language Processing, and leveraging modern data technologies to transform complex data into actionable insights.

I currently serve as a Senior Data Scientist and AI Engineer at Plain Concepts, delivering tailored AI solutions for diverse clients. At the same time, I teach Machine Learning at Universidad San Jorge, connecting academic principles with hands-on industry experience to equip students with the skills needed in the AI landscape.

Earlier, I was Lead Machine Learning Engineer at NTT DATA with roles such as coordinating the team responsible for the AI components of Knowler, a smart knowledge management system, or Research Engineer in the Global Generative AI office. My academic career includes a Ph.D. on signal and data procesing, postdoctoral research at I3A (Instituto de Investigación en Ingeniería de Aragón) on biomedical signal modeling, and lecturing courses in Data Processing, Image Processing, and Signals and Systems at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
